# Give a Safer Web

Are you heading home for the holidays? This year you can give your loved ones a present that will help them year round, and make the world a slightly better place, simply by updating their web browser.

Many people the world over use browser software that hasn't been upgraded in years. Some versions still in use are over a decade old, that's half the lifespan of the web itself!

Year after year security bugs are discovered, demonstrating that these older browsers are unsafe, and should no longer be used. Newer versions will contain the necessary fixes, but unless people upgrade their browsers they remain vulnerable.

Are your parents less technically savvy than you are? How about that wacky uncle? Ask if you can have a look at their computer, and if necessary, if you may give them a newer browser.

The three most common browsers, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, can all be downloaded for free. To see what version of a browser you are currently running, look for an "About" entry in the "Help" menu, or type "about:" in the address bar (including the colon, but without the quotation marks.)

The latest stable versions are

* Internet Explorer: 11
* Google Chrome: 39
* Firefox: 34

By upgrading their browsers you are not only helping them to stay safe on-line, you are also making the world a slightly better place. People creating sites and applications for the web need to make sure their products work on all browsers that are still in common use, including the older ones.

Web related technologies and standards have evolved dramatically in recent years, making newer browsers much more powerful, and easier to target. Having to support these older browsers is tedious, it hampers progress, and comes at a huge cost for the economy. Worst of all, it makes all those designers and programmers creating your internet a little less happy. And nobody should be unhappy at Christmas time!
